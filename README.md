To try it, make sure you have installed a web server like MySQL, and don't forget to install NodeJS as well.

2. Next, make sure that NodeJS is already installed on your PC. Then, go into the backend folder and type 'npm i' on your respective Git Bash or Terminal.
3. If successful, a node_modules folder will appear inside your backend folder.
4. After that, type 'node index.js' on your Git Bash or Terminal.
5. If the terminal outputs 'Server running at http://localhost:5000 Executing (default): SELECT 1+1 AS result DB Berhasil Terhubung', then exit the backend folder and go into the frontend folder. After that, open index.html and try adding a product :)
